# Client Update Notes — 2026-02-03

Client: NorthBridge Bank (fictional)
Engagement: “Knowledge Assistant Pilot” (8-week pilot)

This week’s progress
- Completed initial multi-agent workflow design (planner/research/writer/verifier).
- Implemented trace logging for auditable outputs.

Current risks / blockers
- Outputs need citations to be client-safe.
- Evidence gaps must be clearly labeled as “Not found in sources”.
- Need a lightweight evaluation set for regression testing.

Next steps
- Implement document ingestion and retrieval from non-confidential sample docs.
- Add prompt-injection defenses in research stage.
- Create a client-ready weekly update email.
